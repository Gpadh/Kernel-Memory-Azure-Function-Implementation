# Kernel-Memory-Azure-Function-Implementation

Important things to note:
- This example is set up using a Azure Storage Account with a container in it called "output-files".
- In local.settings.json, please add connection strings to a Azure Storage Account.
- Try triggering the function by blob upload then observe behaviour (breaking case), then uninstall the NuGet packages and trigger it in the same way (working case)
